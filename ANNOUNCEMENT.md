**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**
June 18, 2025

### Introducing chatHMD: The World's First Text-to-LoRA AI Assistant That Runs 100% Locally

Today marks a historic moment in artificial intelligence. We're launching **chatHMD**, the first AI assistant that can learn and adapt to you in real-time, all while keeping your data completely private on your own device.

## Why This Changes Everything

### üß† Text-to-LoRA: AI That Learns Your Language

Imagine telling your AI assistant "be more creative" or "explain things like I'm a developer" and watching it instantly transform its personality. That's the power of Text-to-LoRA technology.

**Example:**
```
You: "Adapt to write like a pirate"
chatHMD: "Ahoy! I be ready to help ye navigate these digital waters, matey!"
```

No training. No waiting. Just instant personalization.

### üîí Your Data Stays Yours

In an age where every keystroke is tracked and analyzed, chatHMD stands apart:
- **100% Local Processing**: Not a single byte leaves your device
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Works completely offline
- **Zero Data Collection**: We literally can't see your conversations

### ‚ö° Blazing Fast on Regular Hardware

Thanks to revolutionary Q4_K_XS quantization:
- **3-5x Faster** than traditional AI models
- **Uses only 7.5GB RAM** (vs 26GB for similar models)
- **Runs on standard laptops** - no expensive GPU required

## Real-World Impact
