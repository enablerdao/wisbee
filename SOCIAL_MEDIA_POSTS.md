Title: We Built an AI That Rewrites Its Own Personality in Real-Time

This might be a glimpse of AGI-like adaptability. Our new AI assistant, chatHMD, can transform its entire personality based on natural language descriptions.

You literally tell it "think like a philosopher" or "be more creative" and it generates neural adaptations (LoRAs) on the fly. No retraining. No fine-tuning. Just instant transformation.

The kicker? It runs entirely on your local machine. No cloud. No data collection.

Is this how future AGI systems will adapt to users? The ability to reshape neural behavior through language feels like a step toward more flexible intelligence.
